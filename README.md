# Parameter_optimization_SVM

Steps:
1. Selection of multi-class dataset from UCI Library. [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition)
2. Division of the dataset into 70-30 for training and testing with 10 different samples.
3. Optimization of the SVM for every sample with 1000 iterations
4. Representation of best parameters in the form of table 
5. Plotting the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum
6. Basic Data Analytics of the dataset
