# Parameter_optimization_SVM

Steps:
1. Selection of multi-class dataset from UCI Library. [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition)
2. Division of the dataset into 70-30 for training and testing with 10 different samples.
3. Optimization of the SVM for every sample with 1000 iterations
4. Representation of best parameters in the form of table 
5. Plotting the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum
6. Basic Data Analytics of the dataset

About Dataset
The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet. The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of 20,000 unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.
